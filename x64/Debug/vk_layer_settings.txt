# ------------------------------------------
# page_guard_separate_read (WINDOWS_X86, WINDOWS_ARM, LINUX, MACOS, ANDROID)
# When the page_guard memory tracking mode is enabled, copies the content of
# pages accessed for read from mapped memory to shadow memory on each read. Can

# capture layer will create an allocation from system memory, which it can
# monitor for write access, and provide that allocation to vkAllocateMemory as
# external memory. Only available on Windows.

# Page Guard Persistent Memory
# ------------------------------------------
# page_guard_persistent_memory (WINDOWS_X86, WINDOWS_ARM, LINUX, MACOS, ANDROID)
# When the page_guard memory tracking mode is enabled, this option changes the
# way that the shadow memory used to detect modifications to mapped memory is
# allocated. The default behavior is to allocate and copy the mapped memory
# range on map and free the allocation on unmap. When this option is enabled, an
# allocation with a size equal to that of the object being mapped is made once
# on the first map and is not freed until the object is destroyed. This option
# is intended to be used with applications that frequently map and unmap large
# memory ranges, to avoid frequent allocation and copy operations that can have
# a negative impact on performance. This option is ignored when
# GFXRECON_PAGE_GUARD_EXTERNAL_MEMORY is enabled.
# This setting requires ALL of the following values:

# Page Guard Align Buffer Sizes
# ------------------------------------------
# page_guard_align_buffer_sizes (WINDOWS_X86, WINDOWS_ARM, LINUX, MACOS, ANDROID)
# When the page_guard memory tracking mode is enabled, this option overrides the
# Vulkan API calls that report buffer memory properties to report that buffer
# sizes and alignments must be a multiple of the system page size. This option
# is intended to be used with applications that perform CPU writes and GPU
# writes/copies to different buffers that are bound to the same page of mapped
# memory, which may result in data being lost when copying pages from the
# page_guard shadow allocation to the real allocation. This data loss can result
# in visible corruption during capture. Forcing buffer sizes and alignments to a
# multiple of the system page size prevents multiple buffers from being bound to
# the same page, avoiding data loss from simultaneous CPU writes to the shadow
# allocation and GPU writes to the real allocation for different buffers bound
# to the same page. This option is only available for the Vulkan API.
# This setting requires ALL of the following values:
